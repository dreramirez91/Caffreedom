# Caffreedom

Caffreedom is a project designed to help users gain better awareness of their caffeine consumption and provide assistance with weaning off caffeine.

## Getting Started

To run Caffreedom on your local machine, you need to run both the frontend (Native) and the backend (Server) components.

### Native (Frontend)

1. Install the Expo Go app on your smartphone.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the 'Native' directory by running: `cd Native`
3. Start the Expo development server by running: `npx expo start`
4. The Expo development server will display a QR code in the terminal.
5. Use your smartphone's camera to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal.
6. This will launch the Caffreedom app in the Expo Go app on your smartphone.

### Server (Backend)

Django backend and PostgreSQL database are deployed through Vercel and Supabase!
